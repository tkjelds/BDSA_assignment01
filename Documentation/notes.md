# NOUN / VERB 

I want a version control system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that I can recall specific versions later. This system should work on any kind of files may they contain source code, configuration data, diagrams, binaries, etc.

I want to use such a system to be able to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, to compare changes over time, to see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, etc.

Version control system
    Record  (changes to file or files)
    Recall  (To a specific version later)
            Work (may they contain source code, configuration data, diagrams, binaries, etc.)

System
    revert  (selected files back to a pervious state)
            (the entire project back to a previous state)
    Compare (changes overtime)
